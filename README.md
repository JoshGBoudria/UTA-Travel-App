# UTA-Travel-App
App designed to support students taking advantage of travel opportunities to foreign countries. Our app will be designed with the intention of being a one-stop-shop for translations, currency rates, and calendar/itinerary features.  

To start a server, run the app.py file. Then go to your web browser and enter the address shown in the console (http://127.0.0.1:5000 by default).
